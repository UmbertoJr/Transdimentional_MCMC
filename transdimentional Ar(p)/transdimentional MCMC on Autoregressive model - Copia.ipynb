    "### Intro to Bayesian model selection using MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to choose the best model that fits our data $y$ using a bayesian approach to the problem. Then we have to define a joint distribution on the Model space $(M,\\mathbf{M}, \\nu())$ and in a natural hierarchical structure expressed by the parameter space given the model m $(\\Theta, \\mathbf{\\Theta}, p())$ and the observed space given model and parameters $(\\Omega, \\mathbf{\\Theta}, f())$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P\\{M = m, \\Theta = \\theta, Y = y\\} = \\nu(m) \\cdot p(\\theta |\\; M=m) \\cdot f(y |\\; \\theta, m)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "that is, the product of model probability, prior and likelihood.\n",
    "Given this setup, is easy to obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P\\{ M= m |\\; Y=y\\}  = \\frac{\\nu(m) \\int_{\\Omega} p(\\theta |\\;M=m) \\cdot f(y |\\; \\theta, m)d\\theta }{ \\sum_{m \\in M}\\nu(m) \\int_{\\Omega} p(\\theta |\\;M=m) \\cdot f(y |\\; \\theta, m)d\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can note that the integral that computes the marginal $f(y|\\;m)$ is only analytically tractable in certain restricted examples, and a further problem is that the size of the set of possible models M may be great that the calculation or the approximation of $f(y|m)$ for all $m\\in M$ becomes infeasible. Therefore MCMC methods which generate observations from the joint posterior of $(m, \\theta_m)$ have become popular for estimating $\\nu(m |\\;y)$ and $p(\\theta |\\;m , y)$ \n",

    "The main property that Green's method wants to exploit is detailed balance condition that is not a necessary condition\n",
    "for ergodicity but together with aperiodicity and irreducibility it's enough to ensure ergodicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_A \\int_B \\pi(dx)\\; P(x, dx^{'}) = \\int_B \\int_A \\pi(dx^{'})\\; P(x^{'}, dx)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the setup also for the Hastings method, that propose a new values $x_T^{'}$ from an arbitrary distribution $q_T(x_T^{'}; x_T)$, and accept the proposed values with probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha( x, x^{'}) = min \\Bigg\\{ 1 , \\frac{\\pi(x_{T}^{'}; x_{-T})\\; q(x_T; x^{'})}{\\pi(x_{T}; x_{-T}^{'})\\; q(x_T^{'}; x)}\\Bigg\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "otherwise, the existing values are reatined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reversible Jump MCMC can be seen as an extension of the Metropolis-Hasting since we still want that the detailed balance condition is verified, but with jumps from samples in different dimensionality.\n",
    "So given ${C_k}$ the subspaces of different dimensionality and $C$ the combined parameter space; when the current state is $x$, we propose a move of type $m$, that would take the state to $dx^{'}$, with probability $q_m(x , \\; dx^{'})$. For the moment, this is an arbitrary sub-probability measure on $m$ and $x^{'}$. Thus $\\sum_m q_m(x, \\; C) < 1$, and with probability $1 - \\sum_m q_m(x, \\; C)$, no change to the present state is proposed. Not all moves $m$ will be available from all starting states $x$, so for each $x$, for some m we have $q_m(x , dx^{'}) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition kernel for such setup can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P\\{x , B \\} = \\sum_m \\int_B q_m(x, dx^{'})\\cdot \\alpha_m(x , x^{'})  \\; + s(x)I(x \\in B)$$ \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So to achieve detailed balance relation, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_m \\int_A \\pi(dx) \\int_B q_m(x , dx^{'}) \\, \\alpha_m(x, x^{'}) + \\int_{A\\cap B} \\pi(dx)\\, s(x)  =  \n",

    "The theoretical results that *Petris and Tardella* have developed, are focused on the idea to build an more automatic approach to multimodel MCMC for the nested-model case.\n",
    "So in this setup we want a sample from a distribution $\\hat \\mu$ (the posterior of a parameter of interest, supported by a sequence of nested hyperplanes in $R^k$. First step is to construct, in a natural fashion, an absolutely continuous distribution $\\hat \\tau$ on $R^k$ and a transformation $\\phi$ from $R^k$ to itself such that $\\hat \\mu = \\hat \\tau \\phi^{-1}$.\n",
    "In this way, even if is not possible to simulate directly from $\\hat \\tau$, it's possible to generate a finite realization $\\zeta_1, ... , \\zeta_n$ of an ergodic MCMC having limiting distribution $\\hat \\tau$, and the approximate a sample from $\\hat \\mu$ with $\\phi(\\zeta_1), ... , \\phi(\\zeta_n)$.\n",

The value of $g$, as $\\zeta$ approaches the boundary of the ball from outside, tends to $f_0(0)$, so this must be the constant value of $g$ within the ball if one wants this function to be continuous.
